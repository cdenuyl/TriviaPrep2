# Trivia Prep App - Task Checklist

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Core Features (Completed in Original Task)

- [X] Create Flask application structure.
- [X] Implement basic data processing for current events, music, movies, sports.
- [X] Create initial HTML template to display data.
- [X] Implement basic category search (placeholder).
- [X] Implement basic geography quiz (small dataset, potential image issues).
- [X] Package application for Render deployment.

## Phase 2: Enhancements and Fixes (Completed)

- **Data Content Expansion & Refinement:**
    - [X] Movies: Expand displayed movies from ~4 to the top 10.
    - [X] TV Shows: Add a new section for current top TV shows, including summaries and actors.
    - [X] Sports: Broaden sports news coverage to include more sports (e.g., Hockey, Baseball, Tennis, Golf).

- **User Interface and Experience:**
    - [X] Sports Section: Redesign the sports section layout to more clearly separate news by sport.
    - [X] Geography Quiz - Images: Resolved issues with images not displaying in the geography quiz (for static questions, now superseded by API).
    - [X] Geography Quiz - Content: Significantly increase the number of questions in the geography quiz (previously 10 static, now dynamic via API).
    - [X] Geography Quiz - Logic: Ensured geography quiz questions were presented randomly and did not repeat until all unique questions in the static pool had been shown (session-based non-repeating logic, now adapted for API batches).
    - [X] Category Search: Improve the category search feature to provide actual, dynamic search results (e.g., top 10-20 web results) instead of placeholder messages or "could not find" errors.

- **Backend and Deployment:**
    - [X] Resolve any deployment errors (e.g., missing dependencies like `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`).
    - [X] Ensure all new data sources are correctly processed and displayed.
    - [X] Update `requirements.txt` with any new dependencies.

## Phase 3: Geography Quiz API Integration (OpenTDB)

- **API Integration & Logic:**
    - [X] Clarify user requirements for OpenTDB API integration (difficulty, amount, refresh).
    - [X] Design and implement backend logic to fetch geography questions from OpenTDB API.
    - [X] Implement dynamic fetching of up to 50 questions per request.
    - [X] Implement logic to handle API response codes and errors gracefully.
    - [X] Implement session-based management for the current batch of API-fetched questions.
    - [X] Implement non-repeating question logic within each fetched batch.
    - [X] Ensure HTML unescaping for questions and answers from the API.

- **User Interface for API Quiz:**
    - [X] Add a dropdown menu for users to select quiz difficulty (Any, Easy, Medium, Hard).
    - [X] Add a "Get Geography Questions" button to trigger API fetching based on selected difficulty.
    - [X] Update the quiz display area to show questions and options from the API.
    - [X] Display question category, difficulty, and type alongside the question.
    - [X] Provide status messages during fetching and for API errors or end-of-batch notifications.
    - [X] Ensure the "Next Question" button works correctly with the API-fetched batch.

- **Validation & Finalization:**
    - [X] Validate fetching of large question pools (up to 50) and refresh behavior.
    - [X] Validate difficulty selection and its effect on API calls.
    - [X] Validate error handling for API issues (e.g., rate limits, no questions found).
    - [X] Update UI and JavaScript to fully support the new API-based quiz features.
    - [X] Prepare a comprehensive summary of API integration changes for the user.
    - [X] Package the updated application (source code and necessary static files) for the user to deploy.
