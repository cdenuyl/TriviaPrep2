## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Core Features (Completed in Original Task)

- [X] Create Flask application structure.
- [X] Implement basic data processing for current events, music, movies, sports.
- [X] Create initial HTML template to display data.
- [X] Implement basic category search (placeholder).
- [X] Implement basic geography quiz (small dataset, potential image issues).
- [X] Package application for Render deployment.

## Phase 2: Enhancements and Fixes (Current Task)

- **Data Content Expansion & Refinement:**
    - [X] Movies: Expand displayed movies from ~4 to the top 10.
    - [X] TV Shows: Add a new section for current top TV shows, including summaries and actors.

- **Finalization:**
    - [X] Validate all new features and fixes thoroughly.
    - [X] Prepare a comprehensive summary of changes for the user.
    - [X] Package the updated application (source code and necessary static files) for the user to deploy.
